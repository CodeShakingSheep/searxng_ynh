The app install dir is `__INSTALL_DIR__`.
Don't edit settings in that directory.
Instead edit them in `__DATA_DIR__/settings.conf`. That file overwrite the default settings thanks to `use_default_settings: true`

Please note that this application is a rolling-release (i.e. each commit is a release) and thus is updated very regularly. People not updating frequently may encounter some bugs or disruptions due to the very nature of this software.
